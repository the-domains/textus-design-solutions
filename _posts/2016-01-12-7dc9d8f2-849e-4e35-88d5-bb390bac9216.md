**Welcome to TDS**, I'm [Christopher Earnhart][0],
Founder, and on most occasions, sole designer and developer. So, unless there is a 
project that requires heavy lifting, or extremely short deadlines, I 
take on most projects solo and one-at-a-time. Each project is **priority one**, and I am a _hands-on_, _responsive_, leader **adapting** to my clients' needs and wants until the project is complete.
